## Introduction
Minecraft SkinViewer allows you to display a skin from a web address (for example, a direct link to a skin image) or from a Minecraft username.  
This tool also offers you the possibility to download the displayed skin, apply it to Minecraft.net or apply it to Minecraft Pocket Edition using a QR Code or a web address.

Minecraft SkinViewer is a project originally developed by [Corbin Davenport](https://corbin.io) and now maintained by [Atnode](https://atnode.fr).

Minecraft SkinViewer is available in English and in French.  
Minecraft SkinViewer is licensed under [GNU GPLv3](license.txt).

**NOTE : Minecraft SkinViewer is not fully compatible with Alex-based skins (Minecraft 1.8+).**
