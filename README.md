Skin Manager
================
Skin Manager is a rewrite of [Skin Finder](http://www.poweredbyredstone.net/?p=1748), a tool I designed to download Minecraft skins by entering their username. Skin Manager allows you to open a skin from a Minecraft username or URL, then save it to your computer, Mojang/Minecraft account, or mobile device for use with Minecraft: Pocket Edition.

Skin Manager is designed to be embedded on other sites. To embed Skin Manager, place this iframe tag on your page:

```
<iframe src="http://corbindavenport.github.io/skin-manager" style="width: 100%; height: 470px; border: 0px;"></iframe>
```


Skin Manager uses [Metro UI CSS 3.0](http://metroui.org.ua), the [Bit.ly API](http://dev.bitly.com), and the [QR Server API](http://goqr.me/api/).
